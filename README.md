#### Abstract
From default args, to `**kwargs`, and everything in-between, Python's comprehensive argument system lends itself to some of the most effective code, through encouraging readability, reuse, and easy refactoring.

But is that really true? Why, and why not?

What could we learn from other languages?

And what else could lie in their future?  

#### Description
In this session, Evan will give a rundown of Python's comprehensive function argument system and how its features allow for safety, conciseness, and expressiveness (whether you're calling or writing functions).

He'll then give examples for where that system lacks, where it could bite you, and give suggestions for what more could be done on Python code to fix those limitations.

## Setup 
1. Since reveal.js exists as a submodule, `git clone --recurse-submodules` needs to be used when cloning (or `git submodule update --init --recursive` if already cloned).
2. `cd src/reveal.js && npm install`
3. `cd ../../ && ./start`

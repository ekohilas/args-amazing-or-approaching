Hello everyone!

I'm Evan, and as someone who's super passionate about achieving nohumanerrors.com,

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/angry.svg"-->

What they've done to re.sub from Python 3.13...

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/excited.svg"-->

really exictes me!

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/question_mark.svg"-->

So what did they do? Stay to the end to find out!

> Mayve start with the problem and then
> Why? Because it fixes the error in this code.
> What's the error?, well stay tuned to find out.
> Nah I won't do that to you

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/kidding.svg"-->

Nah I wouldn't do that to you.

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/positional_deprecated.svg"-->

What they did was deprecate passing in positional arguments.

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/but_why.gif"-->

But why?

Well that's the most exciting part for me.

And if you hear me out, you too, can learn why it should excite you!

Full disclosure, I _might_ be biased by having the utmost adoration for python's beautiful function argument system.

---
```java
Rectangle rectangle(
    int width,
    int height,
    int rotation
);
```

To show what I mean, I'll start with a function from another language, that creates a rectangle.
In this language, if we want to setup rotation to default to 0,

------
```java
Rectangle rectangle(
    int width,
    int height
) {
    rectangle(width, height, 0);
}
```

then we often need to define an overload of the function name, that calls it with our defaults.

> TODO: remove the need for overloading?

------
```python [4]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...

normal = rectangle(width, height)
rotated = rectangle(width, height, rotation)
```

But in python, since we have default arguments...

------
```python [8-9]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...

normal = rectangle(width, height)
rotated = rectangle(width, height, rotation)
```

there's no need for chained overloads, because if we don't specify a rotation, it'll default to 0 instead.

---
```java
Rectangle.builder(height, width)
    .build();
 
```
<!-- .element: data-notrim -->

Other languages fix this problem through builders, that store and create this state,

---
```java
Rectangle.builder(height, width)
    .withRotation(rotation)
    .build();
```

resolving this issue by allowing for optionally added data.

------
```java
Rectangle.builder(height, width)
    .build();
 
```
<!-- .element: data-notrim -->

But yet another issue lies, due to the nature of these **required** ordered arguments.
And that is that there's no knowing whether the arguments are set correctly 

------
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```java
Rectangle.builder(height, width)
    .build();
  
```
<!-- .element: data-notrim -->
<!-- .element: data-id="builder" -->

For example, put your hand up, if you noticed, that when I defined this builder, the ordering of height and width were swapped?

(Pause to look)

Even with [so many] people in this audience, there's actually only [a few] of you that realised that it should be width and height,

------
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```java [1,5,6]
Rectangle.builder(height, width)
    .build();
 
void rectangle(
    int width,
    int height
);
```
<!-- .element: data-id="builder" -->

Not height and width.

(3s pause)

And that's not your fault, because for one, this is a lightning talk, and two, there's no knowing whether the arguments are set correctly, without having to reference the signature of the functions.

---
```python
rectangle(
    width=width,
    height=height,
)
```

Python is beautiful, in that it solves this with keyword arguments (and thus also does away with builders)

------
```python
rectangle(
    width=1,
    height=2,
)
```

Meaning that not only are our functions self documenting by having constant arguments labelled

------
```python
rectangle(
    height=2,
    width=1,
)
```

But now our argument ordering is redundant!

------
```python
rectangle(
    width=width,
    height=height,
)
```

Thus, by always using keyword arguments, our code is always future proofed against errors,

---
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```python []
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...

    
rectangle(1, 2, 3,)
```
<!-- .element: data-id="rectangle" -->

Like for example, if we go back to a default argument being used for rotation

------
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```python [9-13]
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...

    
rectangle(
    1,
    2,
    3,
)
```
<!-- .element: data-id="rectangle" -->

then we could call that function,

------
```python [12]
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...

    
rectangle(
    1, # height
    2, # width
    3, # rotation
)
```

with the 3rd argument overriding that default.

------
```python [4]
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    opacity,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    1,
    2,
    3,
)
```

But once we introduce a new required positional argument like opacity

------
```python [9-13]
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    opacity,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    1, # height
    2, # width
    3, # rotation
)
```

where 1, 2, and 3 were previously for height, width, and rotation

------
```python [12]
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    opacity,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    1, # height
    2, # width
    3, # opacity
)
```

They're now actually for height, width, and opacity, without us ever knowing.

------
```python [10-12]
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    opacity,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    height=1,
    width=2,
    opacity=3,
)
```

Naming our arguments easily lets us prevent this issue!

---
```python []
def rectangle(
    height,
    width,
    opacity,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    height=1,
    width=2,
    opacity=3,
)
```

But in addition, also reduces issues with refactoring!

------
```python [2-3]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
    opacity,
    rotation=0,
):
    ... 
    
rectangle(
    height=1,
    width=2,
    opacity=3,
)
```

such as in the case where we want to fix the mis-ordered parameters,

------
```python [10-11]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
    opacity,
    rotation=0,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    height=1,
    width=2,
    opacity=3,
)
```

we now don't have to make changes to re-order those arguments where that function is called.

But even in the cases where you're not refactoring, not using keyword arguments has led to errors.

------
```python
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
```

And this takes us back to `re.sub`

Can I get a show of hands if you can spot the error in this example, and didn't know before this talk?  

> TODO: Surpise code review! can you spot the error?

[That's about X of you!]

------
```python[5]
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)
```

The error is here, with how the `re.IGNORECASE` flag is being passed in.

And if you didn't spot it, I don't blame you.

How can anyone be expected to quickly spot this error amongst so much complexity?

>  https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/56166

------
```python[8-14]
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)

def sub(
    pattern,
    repl,
    string,
    count=0,
    flags=0,
)
```

If we bring up the definition of re.sub,

------
```python[5,12]
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)

def sub(
    pattern,
    repl,
    string,
    count=0,
    flags=0,
)
```

and we look at the parameter that the flag is passed in as, you'll see it's count, not flags.

------
```python[5]
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    re.IGNORECASE, # 2
)

def sub(
    pattern,
    repl,
    string,
    count=0,
    flags=0,
)
```

and then the flag is read as an int, setting the maximum number of subtitutions to 2.

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/frustrated.svg"-->

That would explain why I spent hours trying to figure out why my expected thousands of substitutions weren't working, and was instead second guessing my replacement function.

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/positional_deprecated.svg"-->

In fact, so many people have had this issue, that Python has fixed it by introducing a deprecation warning from 3.13, noting that the use of count and flags as a positional arguments will be removed and will now need to be a keyword arguments instead.

------
```python[5]
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    flags=re.IGNORECASE,
)

def sub(
    pattern,
    repl,
    string,
    count=0,
    flags=0,
)
```

So what Python is now suggesting we do, is to pass in `flags` using the keyword argument.

------
```python [12]
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    flags=re.IGNORECASE,
)

def sub(
    pattern,
    repl,
    string,
    *,
    count=0,
    flags=0,
)
```

And in future, they'll likely change flags and count to be required, by adding a * in the function signature

------
```python [5,8-10]
re.sub(
    r"(\w+)(\[.*?\])\s*\n(.*?)",
    replacement_function,
    content,
    re.IGNORECASE,
)

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: sub() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given

```

What this will do, is throw us an error when we try to call the function without naming those arguments following the `*`

> TODO:
> This is only one of the few reasons why I love keyword arguments and python's beautiful function argument system
> If this alone doesn't convince you of keyword arguments, consider the case where content and pattern are swapped (for ordering) 
> Keyword arguments don't only solve problems with default positional arguments
> They also solve misordering of positional arguments
> And make fixing them easier
> And make them self documenting 

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/convinced.svg"-->

so if you've now been convinced to use keyword arguments

------
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```python [2,9-10]
def rectangle(
    *,
    width,
    height,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    height=1,
    width=2,
)
```
<!-- .element: data-id="named" -->

you _could_ require that in all your functions by putting `*` as the first parameter

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/agonising.svg"-->

But that can be tedious, as it can be forgotten, can make the code noisy, and would also require updating **all** previously made functions.

> TODO: Update by splitting to require `*` in one part, and then mentioning the linter rule working without star in another.

------
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```python [2, 10-11]
def rectangle(
    *
    width,
    height,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    height=height,
    width=width,
)
```
<!-- .element: data-id="named" -->

Not to mention the redundant cases where the names of the variables being passed in are the same as the parameters.

And while it might look fine in this case,

------
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```python
rectangle(
    top_left_pos_from_x_origin=top_left_pos_from_x_origin,
    top_left_pos_from_y_origin=top_left_pos_from_x_origin,
    bottom_right_pos_from_x_origin=bottom_right_pos_from_x_origin,
    bottom_right_pos_from_y_origin=bottom_right_pos_from_y_origin,
    rotation_in_radians=rotation_in_radians,
    color_in_hex=color_in_hex,
    line_thickness_in_pixels=line_thickness_in_pixels,
)
```
<!-- .element: data-id="named" -->

it can get pretty unreadable or error prone when the number of parameters and their names are much longer

------
<!-- .element: data-auto-animate -->
```python [2]
rectangle(
    top_left_pos_from_x_origin=top_left_pos_from_x_origin,
    top_left_pos_from_y_origin=top_left_pos_from_x_origin,
    bottom_right_pos_from_x_origin=bottom_right_pos_from_x_origin,
    bottom_right_pos_from_y_origin=bottom_right_pos_from_y_origin,
    rotation_in_radians=rotation_in_radians,
    color_in_hex=color_in_hex,
    line_thickness_in_pixels=line_thickness_in_pixels,
)
```
<!-- .element: data-id="named" -->

Did anyone notice the typo on this line?, where the parameter and argument should both be `y`

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/ruff.svg"-->

This is where linters come in!

I **love** linters, as they're a cleaner, more pragmatic way to not only check, but also correct this for us!

------
```python [8-9]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    height=height,
    width=width,
)
```

For example, a rule that auto fixes all our function calls to use keyword arguments wherever possible

------
```python[2-3,8-9]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    width,
    width,
)
```

Or, if you want the safety without the redundancy, a rule that checks that for every given positional argument, it's name is the same as the corresponding parameter.

------
```python[2,8]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    width,
    width,
)
```

Which would pass in this case,

------
```python[3,9]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    width,
    width, # WARN: `width` passed into parameter named `height`
)
```

and in this case, give a warning,

------
```python[3,9]
def rectangle(
    width,
    height,
):
    ...
    
rectangle(
    width,
    height=width,
)
```

or bring clarity with a keyword argument.

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/sprints.svg"-->

So if mitigating human errors excites you, I'd love to work with you in make these kinds of tools a reality!

------
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/inspired.svg"-->

Or, if at the least I've inspired you enough to use this paradigm in your code day to day, there's one thing worth noting. 

> TODO: Cut out?

------
```python
range(
    start=0,
    stop=10, 
    skip=2,
)   
```

You may notice in your excitement to use keyword arguments for all your function calls...

------
```python
range(
    start=0,
    stop=10, 
    skip=2,
)   

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: range() takes no keyword arguments
```

that not _all_ functions are happy with that.

------
```python[5]
def range(
    start,
    stop,
    skip=1,
    /,
)
```

And maybe this is a call to action for removing the offending `/` special parameter,

------
```python
def range(
    start,
    stop,
    skip=1,
)
```

allowing for consistency (granted that maybe this isn't the best example)
